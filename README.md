Welcome to your new dbt project!

### Using the starter project

Try running the following commands:
- dbt run
- dbt test


### Commands

- #### **dbt init**

  Command: `dbt init my_project`

  Explanation: Initializes a new dbt project named `my_project` in the current directory.

- #### **dbt run**

  Command: `dbt run`

  Explanation: Executes the SQL code defined in your dbt models to create or update tables/views in your data warehouse.
